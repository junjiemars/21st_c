# x86

Machine languages consist entirely of numbers and are almost impossible for humans to
read and write. Assembly languages have the same structure and set of commands as
machine languages, but they enable a programmer to use names instead of numbers.

## Memory

### Addressing Data in Memory
The process through which the processor controls the execution of instructions is 
referred as **fetch-decode-execute cycle** or the **execution cycle**. It consists
of three continuous steps:
* fetching the instruction from memory
* decoding or identifying the instruction
* executing the instruction

There are two kinds of memory addresses:
* absolute address: a direct reference of specific location
* segment address (or offset): starting address of a memory segment with the offset 
value

### Memory Segments
A segmented memory model divides the system memory into groups of independent 
segments referenced by pointers located in the segment registers. Each segment is 
used to contain a specific type of data. 
* data segment: it is represented by **.data** section and **.bss**. It is used to 
declare the memory region, where data elements are stored for the program. 
This section cannot be expanded after the data elements are declared, 
and it remains static throughout the program.
* code segment: it is represented by **.text** section. This defines an area in memory
that stores the instruction codes. This is also a fixed area. 
* stack: it contains values passed to functions and procedures within the program.

## Registers

![AX Register](ax.png)


### Data Registers

* AX: is the primary **accumulator**, it is used in input/output and most arithmetic 
instructions.
* BX: is known as the **base** register, as it could be used in indexed addressing. 
* CX: is known as the **counter** register, store the loop count in iterative 
operations.
* DX: is known as the **data** register, it is also used in input/output operations.
And also used with AX register along with DX for multiply and divde operations 
involving large values.


### Pointer Registers

* IP: **instruction pointer** register stores the offset address of the next 
instruction to be executed. IP in association with CS register (as CS:IP) 
gives the complete address of the current instruction in the code segment.
* SP: **stack pointer** register provides the offset value within the program stack.
* BP: **basic pointer** (aka. frame pointer) mainly helps in referencing the 
parameter variables passed to a subroutine. The address in SS register is combined 
with the offset in BP to get the location of the parameter. BP can also be combined 
with DI and SI as base registerfor special addressing.

### Index Registers

Are used for indexed addressing and sometimes used in addition and subtraction.
* SI: **source index** it is used as source index for string operations.
* DI: **destination index** it is used as destination index for string operations.


### Segment Registers
Segments are specific areas defined in a program for containing data, code and stack.
Thre are thre main segments:
* CS: **code segment** it contains all the instructions to be executed. Stores the 
starting address of the code segment.
* DS: **data segment** it contains data, contains and work areas. Stores the starting
address of the data segment.
* SS: **stack segment** it contains data and return addresses of procedure or 
subroutines. It is implemented as a **stack** data structure. Stores the starting
address of the stack.

All memory locations within a segment are relative to the starting address of the 
segment. To get the exact location of data or instruction within a segment, an offset
value (or displacement) is required.


### Control Registers
Many instructions involve comparisons and mathematical calculations and change the
status of the flags and some other conditional instructions test the value of these
status flags to take the control flow to other location.

|  Flags: |    |    |    |    |  O |  D | I | T | S | Z |   | A |   | P |   | C |
|:-------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Bit#    | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |


|  Bit#  |  Abbrreviation |      Description       |   Category    |
|:------:|:--------------:|:-----------------------|:-------------:|
|  0     |  CF            | Carry flag             | status        |
|  2     |  PF            | Parity flag            | status        |
|  4     |  AF            | Adjust flag            | status        |
|  6     |  ZF            | Zero flag              | status        |
|  7     |  SF            | Sign flag              | status        |
|  8     |  TF            | Trap flag              | status        |
|  9     |  IF            | Interrupt enable flag  | status        |
| 10     |  DF            | Direction flag         | status        |
| 11     |  OF            | Overflow flag          | status        |


## Conditional Jumps

Jump instructions operate on signed integers.


| OP  | Jump Condition           | Test                     |
|:----|:-------------------------|:-------------------------|
| JE  | jump if Equal            | ZF = 1                   |
| JNE | jump if Not Equal        | ZF = 0                   |
| JG  | jump if Greater          | ZF = 0 AND SF = OF       |
| JGE | jump if Greater or Equal | SF = OF                  |
| JL  | jump if Less             | SF != OF                 |
| JLE | jump if Less or Equal    | ZF = 1 OR SF != OF       |


## Basic Instructions

Here, we use AT&T syntax to descript those instructions.

### Move

Move instruction: ```mov[x] <source> <dest>```, and ```x``` will be b(byte), w(word), l(long), q(quad).


### Transfer data between memory and register

* __Load__ data from memory into register: %R = M[address]
* __Store__ register data into memory: M[address] = %R


### Operand Types

* Immediate: constant data, eg., ```$0x400```
* Registers
* Memory: block bytes of memory at address given by register, eg., ```(%rax)```


### movq Operand Combinations

* I => R: ```movq $0x4, %rax      => a = 0x4;```
* I => M: ```movq $0x4, (%rax)    => *p = 0x5;```
* R => R: ```movq %rax, %rdx      => a = b;```
* R => M: ```movq %rax, (%rdx)    => *p = a;```
* M => R: ```movq (%rax), %rdx    => b = *p;```


### Memory Addressing Modes

* Indirect: (R) => M[R[x]] eg., ```movq (%rcx), %rax```
* Displacement: D(R) => M[R[x]+D] eg., ```movq -0x8(%rbp), %rdx```


## Stack 
In computers, the stack is usually a specially treated region of memory. And a 
stack frame is a frame of data that gets pushed onto the stack. In the case of
a call stack, a stack frame would represent a function call and its argument data.


### Top of Stack

### Stacks in memory and stack operations

### The stack used to keep track of procedure calls

### Return addresses and return values

### Stack-based lanuages

### The Linux stack frame

### Passing arguments on the stack

### Alocating local variables on the stack

### Register-saving conventions

### Procedures and stacks on x64 architecture


## Calling Conventions
> Another important change that was made in the Windows x64 ABI is 
> the cleanup of calling conventions. 
> No more ```cdecl/stdcall/fastcall/thiscall/register/safecall``` madness:
> just a single "x64 calling convention". Cheers to that!


### cdecl
* Arguments are passed on the stack in Right-to-Left order, and return values are 
passed in _eax_
* The caller cleans the stack. This allows _cdecl_ functions to have 
variable-length argument lists (aka variadic function). For this reason the number
of arguments is not appended to the name of the function by the compiler, and the
assembler and the linker are therefore unable to detemine if an incorrect number
of arguments is used.

|  32 bits  |  64 bits  |                                                     |
|----------:|----------:|:----------------------------------------------------|
|  16(%ebp) |  32(%rbp) |  third function parameter                           |
|  12(%ebp) |  24(%rbp) |  second function parameter                          |
|   8(%ebp) |  16(%rbp) |  first function parameter                           |
|   4(%ebp) |   8(%rbp) |  old %eip|%rip (the function's return address)      |
|   0(%ebp) |   0(%rbp) |  old %ebp|%rbp (previous function's base pointer)   |
|  -4(%ebp) |  -8(%rbp) |  first local variable                               |
|  -8(%ebp) | -16(%rbp) |  second local variable                              |
| -12(%ebp) | -24(%rbp) |  third local variable                               |

### stdcall
* Passes arguments Right-to-Left, and returns the value in _eax_.
* The callee cleans the stack, unlike _cdecl_.

### fastcall
* The first 2 or 3 arguments are passed in registers (aka edx, eax, ecx)
* Additional arugments, or arguments larger than 4-bytes are passed on the stack, 
often in Right-to-Left order.
* The caller is responsible for cleaning the stack, if needed.

## How to play
