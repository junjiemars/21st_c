## CPU

While memory stores the program and data, the _Central Processing Unit_ does 
all the work. The CPU has two parts: _registers_ and _Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU)_.
The ALU performs the actual computations such as addtion and multiplication along 
with comparison and other logical operations.


One of the specialized registers is the _Program Counter_, or _PC_, which holds 
the address of which instruction is currently being executed.


### Load
Load instructions read bytes into register. The source may be a constant value, 
another register, or a location in memory.

```asm
;; load the constant 23 into register 4
R4 = 23

;; copy the contents of register 2 into register 3
R3 = R2

;; load char (one byte) starting at memory address 244 into register 6
R6 = .1 M[244]

;; load R5 with the word whose memory address is in R1
R5 = M[R1]

;; load the word that begins 8 bytes after the address in R1.
;; this is known as constant offset mode and is about the fanciest
;; addressing mode a RISC processor will support
R4 = M[R1+8]
```

### Store
Store instructions are basically the reverse of load instructions: 
they move values from registers back out to memory.

```asm
;; store the constant number 37 into the word beginning at 400
M[400] = 37

;; store the value in R6 into the word whose address is in R1
M[R1] = R6

;; store lower half-word from R2 into 2 bytes starting at address 1024
M[1024] = .2 R2

;; store R7 into the word whose address is 12 more than the address in R1
M[R1+12] = R7
```

### ALU

ALU instructions are much like the operation keys of a calculator and only 
work with the registers or constants.

```asm
;; add 6 to R3 and store the result in R1
R1 = 6 + R3

;; subtract R3 from R2 and store the result in R1
R1 = R2 - R3
```

### Branching

By default, the CPU fetches and executes instructions from memory in order, 
working from low memory to high. Branch instructions alter this order.
Branch instructions test a condition and possibly change which instruction 
should be executed next by changing the value of the PC register. The operands 
in the test of a branch statement must be in registers or constant values. 
Branches are used to implement control structures like ```if``` as well as 
loops like ```for``` and ```while```.


```asm
;; begin executing at address 344 if R1 equals 0
BEQ R1, 0, 344

;; begin executing at address 8 past current instruction if R2 less than R3
BLT R2, R3, PC+8
```

The full set of branch variants:
* ```BLT```: branch if first argument is less than second
* ```BLE```: less than or equal
* ```BGT```: greater than
* ```BGE```: greater than or equal
* ```BEQ```: equal
* ```BNE```: not equal


In addition, there is an unconditional jump that has no test, but just immediately 
diverts execution to new address.
```asm
;; begin executing at address 2000 unconditionally: like a goto
JMP 2000

;; begin executing at address 12 before current instruction
JMP PC-12
```


### Type Conversion
The types ```char```, ```short```, ```int```, and ```long``` are all in the same 
family, and use the same binary polynomial representation.

* narrow: C allows you to freely assin between these types. When assigning from a 
smaller-sized type to a larger, there is no problem. All of the source bytes are 
copied and the remaining upper bytes in the destination are filled using what is 
called _sign extension__-- the sign bit is extended across the extra bytes.
* broaden: only copy the lower bytes and ignores the upper bytes.


Remember a floating point 1.0 has a completely different arrangement of bits than 
the integer 1 and instruction are required to do those conversions.


```asm
;; take bits in R3 that represent integer, convert to float, store in R2
R2 = ItoF R3

;; take bits in R4, convert from float to int, and store back in same Note
;; that converting in this direction loses information, the fractional component 
;; is truncated and lost
R4 = FtoI R4
```


### Typecast

A _typecast_ is a compile-time entity that instructs the compiler to treat an 
expression differently than its declared type when generating code for that 
expression. 

* casting a pointer from one type to another could change the offset was multiplied 
for pointer arithmetic or how many bytes were copied on a pointer dereference.
* some typecasts are actually _type conversions_. A type conversion is required when 
the data needs to be converted from one representation to another, such as when 
changing an integer to floating point representation or vice versa.
* most often, a cast does affect the generated code, since the compiler will be 
treating the expression as a different type.

```c
{ 
    int i;
    ((struct binky *)i)->b = 'A';
}
```
What does this code actually do at runtime? Why would your ever want to do such a 
thing? The typecast is one of the reasons C is a fundamentatlly unsafe launguage.


## Data Sizes
|            | Size (bytes) | Size (bits) |
|:----------:|-------------:|------------:|
|    Word    |            2 |          16 |
| Doubleword |            4 |          32 |
|  Quadword  |            8 |          64 |
| Paragraph  |           16 |         128 |

## Memory

### Addressing Data in Memory
The process through which the processor controls the execution of instructions is 
referred as **fetch-decode-execute cycle** or the **execution cycle**. It consists
of three continuous steps:
* fetching the instruction from memory
* decoding or identifying the instruction
* executing the instruction

There are two kinds of memory addresses:
* absolute address: a direct reference of specific location
* segment address (or offset): starting address of a memory segment with the offset 
value

### Memory Segments
A segmented memory model divides the system memory into groups of independent 
segments referenced by pointers located in the segment registers. Each segment is 
used to contain a specific type of data. 
* data segment: it is represented by **.data** section and **.bss**. It is used to 
declare the memory region, where data elements are stored for the program. 
This section cannot be expanded after the data elements are declared, 
and it remains static throughout the program.
* code segment: it is represented by **.text** section. This defines an area in memory
that stores the instruction codes. This is also a fixed area. 
* stack: it contains values passed to functions and procedures within the program.

## Register

![AX Register](ax.png)


### Data Registers

* AX: is the primary **accumulator**, it is used in input/output and most arithmetic 
instructions.
* BX: is known as the **base** register, as it could be used in indexed addressing. 
* CX: is known as the **counter** register, store the loop count in iterative 
operations.
* DX: is known as the **data** register, it is also used in input/output operations.
And also used with AX register along with DX for multiply and divde operations 
involving large values.


### Pointer Registers

* IP: **instruction pointer** register stores the offset address of the next 
instruction to be executed. IP in association with CS register (as CS:IP) 
gives the complete address of the current instruction in the code segment.
* SP: **stack pointer** register provides the offset value within the program stack.
* BP: **basic pointer** (aka. frame pointer) mainly helps in referencing the 
parameter variables passed to a subroutine. The address in SS register is combined 
with the offset in BP to get the location of the parameter. BP can also be combined 
with DI and SI as base registerfor special addressing.

### Index Registers

Are used for indexed addressing and sometimes used in addition and subtraction.
* SI: **source index** it is used as source index for string operations.
* DI: **destination index** it is used as destination index for string operations.


### Segment Registers
Segments are specific areas defined in a program for containing data, code and stack.
Thre are thre main segments:
* CS: **code segment** it contains all the instructions to be executed. Stores the 
starting address of the code segment.
* DS: **data segment** it contains data, contains and work areas. Stores the starting
address of the data segment.
* SS: **stack segment** it contains data and return addresses of procedure or 
subroutines. It is implemented as a **stack** data structure. Stores the starting
address of the stack.

All memory locations within a segment are relative to the starting address of the 
segment. To get the exact location of data or instruction within a segment, an offset
value (or displacement) is required.


### Control Registers
Many instructions involve comparisons and mathematical calculations and change the
status of the flags and some other conditional instructions test the value of these
status flags to take the control flow to other location.

|  Flags: |    |    |    |    |  O |  D | I | T | S | Z |   | A |   | P |   | C |
|:-------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Bit#    | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |


|  Bit#  |  Abbrreviation |      Description       |   Category    |
|:------:|:--------------:|:-----------------------|:-------------:|
|  0     |  CF            | Carry flag             | status        |

|  6     |  ZF            | Zero flag              | status        |
|  7     |  SF            | Sign flag              | status        |
|  8     |  TF            | Trap flag              | status        |
|  9     |  IF            | Interrupt enable flag  | status        |
| 10     |  DF            | Direction flag         | status        |
| 11     |  OF            | Overflow flag          | status        |


### Conditional Jump

Jump instructions operate on signed integers.


| OP  | Jump Condition           | Test                     |
|:----|:-------------------------|:-------------------------|
| JE  | jump if Equal            | ZF = 1                   |
| JNE | jump if Not Equal        | ZF = 0                   |
| JG  | jump if Greater          | ZF = 0 AND SF = OF       |
| JGE | jump if Greater or Equal | SF = OF                  |
| JL  | jump if Less             | SF != OF                 |
| JLE | jump if Less or Equal    | ZF = 1 OR SF != OF       |


## Basic Instructions

Machine languages consist entirely of numbers and are almost impossible for humans to
read and write. Assembly languages have the same structure and set of commands as
machine languages, but they enable a programmer to use names instead of numbers.


Here, we use AT&T syntax to descript those instructions.

### Move

Move instruction: ```mov[x] <source> <dest>```, and ```x``` will be b(byte), w(word), l(long), q(quad).


### Transfer data between memory and register

* __Load__ data from memory into register: %R = M[address]
* __Store__ register data into memory: M[address] = %R


### Operand Types

* Immediate: constant data, eg., ```$0x400```
* Registers
* Memory: block bytes of memory at address given by register, eg., ```(%rax)```


### movq Operand Combinations

* I => R: ```movq $0x4, %rax      => a = 0x4;```
* I => M: ```movq $0x4, (%rax)    => *p = 0x5;```
* R => R: ```movq %rax, %rdx      => a = b;```
* R => M: ```movq %rax, (%rdx)    => *p = a;```
* M => R: ```movq (%rax), %rdx    => b = *p;```


### Memory Addressing Modes

* Indirect: (R) => M[R[x]] eg., ```movq (%rcx), %rax```
* Displacement: D(R) => M[R[x]+D] eg., ```movq -0x8(%rbp), %rdx```


## Function Call
In a lanuage that features recursion, it is necessary to distinguish between the 
definition of a function and a call to that function. The definition of a function 
defines how that function behaves. A call to the function creates an _instance_ or 
_activation_ of that function. Although a function has only one defintion, over 
time it will have many distinct instances.

Each instance has memory requirements. Between the time a function is called and 
the time it exits, a function's activation record requires memory to contain:
* local storage: parameters, local variables, and any auxiliary space the compiler 
has determined is neccessary to implement that function's block of code.
* return information: where and how execution should continue when this call exits.

### Activation Records
The memory block allocated for each activation is called an _activation record_. 
The memory within an activation record is only valid while the function is 
executing; once the function exits, the memory is reclaimed.

An _activation record_ stores the state associated with one instance, or call, of a 
function.

## Stack 
A _stack_ is the perfect structure to allocate and de-allocate activations. When 
a function is activated, space for one of its activation records is pushed onto 
the stack and initialized. The activation record must remain intact so long as 
the function executes. When the function exits, the memory for its activation 
record can be reclaimed. The activation record is popped from the stack and the 
previous function's activation will become the one on top of the stack.

In computers, the stack is usually a specially treated region of memory. And a 
stack frame is a frame of data that gets pushed onto the stack. In the case of
a call stack, a stack frame would represent a function call and its argument data.


### Top of Stack

![Top of Stack](top-of-stack.png)


### Stacks in memory and stack operations

### The stack used to keep track of procedure calls

### Return addresses and return values

### Stack-based lanuages

### Passing arguments on the stack

### Alocating local variables on the stack

### Register-saving conventions

### Procedures and stacks on x64 architecture


## Calling Conventions
> Another important change that was made in the Windows x64 ABI is 
> the cleanup of calling conventions. 
> No more ```cdecl/stdcall/fastcall/thiscall/register/safecall``` madness:
> just a single "x64 calling convention". Cheers to that!


### cdecl
* Arguments are passed on the stack in Right-to-Left order, and return values are 
passed in _eax_
* The caller cleans the stack. This allows _cdecl_ functions to have 
variable-length argument lists (aka variadic function). For this reason the number
of arguments is not appended to the name of the function by the compiler, and the
assembler and the linker are therefore unable to detemine if an incorrect number
of arguments is used.

### stdcall
* Passes arguments Right-to-Left, and returns the value in _eax_.
* The callee cleans the stack, unlike _cdecl_.

### fastcall
* The first 2 or 3 arguments are passed in registers (aka edx, eax, ecx)
* Additional arugments, or arguments larger than 4-bytes are passed on the stack, 
often in Right-to-Left order.
* The caller is responsible for cleaning the stack, if needed.
