# C Lessons
It is not **C Lessons** at all :). I'd programming in C long long time ago, sometimes I want to
pick something up, but I cannot find the peice of code somewhere or cannot run the code 
on a machine that been wrote in another machine. 

Sadly, old dog need learn something new
* Access the code from anywhere, oh, GitHub is good one
* Run or Write code on anywhere, so Linux, Darwin, or Windows, Docker Box
* Easy to try and learn something new

Now, we had [Nore](https://github.com/junjiemars/nore), something changed and 
something not.


## Hot to Play
```sh
$ bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junjiemars/nore/master/bootstrap.sh)

$ nore/auto/configure --has-hi
$ make
$ make install
```


## C Lessons
This part is the **Lessons** indeed, ... Quiet!
